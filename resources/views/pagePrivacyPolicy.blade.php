            <h3><strong>Access to Personal Data</strong></h3>
            <p>We will, upon your written request to our Data Protection Officer (see contact details and requirements below), allow you to enquire about the ways in which your personal data has been or may have been used or disclosed within a year before the request.

            <h3><strong>Security of Personal Data</strong></h3>
            <p>We are committed to ensuring the security and protection of your Personal Data in our possession or our control by making reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, copying modification, disposal or similar risks.<p>
            <p>We maintain physical, electronic and procedural safeguards to protect your Personal Data. For example:-<p>
            <ul>
                <li>We use industry-standard Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL") authentication to ensure the confidentiality of online transactions made on our site. SSL authentication and encryption of the information that you send to us over the Internet help protect your online transaction information from third party interception.</li>

                <li>We ensure that our appointed IT service provider has the necessary security protocols in place to host and protect our data.</li>
            </ul>

Despite all of our efforts, there is always a risk that third parties may unlawfully intercept transmissions. This reality is true of all Internet use. Further, we are not responsible for the privacy statements or content on websites not controlled by us.</p>
            <p>If you access our website from a shared computer or a computer in an internet cafe, a library, or any public facility, certain information about you, such as your user ID, activity or reminders from our website, may also be visible to other individuals who use the computer after you. To protect your Personal Data or communication from being disclosed to others, you should log out, clear browsing data and close the web browser after using our website.<p>
            <p>You should be aware of the risks associated with disclosing any information or transacting over the Internet or when using online portals, and we urge you to take every precaution when using the Internet to disclose your Personal Data to us, including using strong passwords, changing your password regularly, using a secure browser and not to share your password with anyone or via an unsolicited phone call or e-mail.</p>
            <p>We will never ask for your password by phone or e-mail, so if you receive such an enquiry, please report the incident to our Data Protection Officer at <a href="devops@gush.co">devops@gush.co</a>.</p>
            <p>If applicable, you undertake to keep your username and password secure and confidential and shall not disclose or permit it to be disclosed to any unauthorised person, and to inform us as soon as reasonably practicable if you know or suspect that someone else knows your username and password or believe the confidentiality of your username and password has been lost, stolen or compromised in any way or that actual or possible unauthorised transactions have taken place.</p>
            <p>We are not liable for any loss or damage resulting from your act or omission to safe-keep your username and password from unauthorised use, and also for any information you transmit over the Internet which you do so solely at your own risk.</p>
            <p>Further rights of data subjects in the European Union ("EU")</p>
            <p>In the event that we have existing access and consent to your Personal Data, and you are a data subject in the EU, please contact us should you wish to exercise any of the following further rights:-</p>

                <li>request to transfer your personal Data to you or a third-party.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All requests made to us in exercising the rights above will be processed within a reasonable time except where we refuse such requests in accordance with any applicable laws or regulations.</p>
